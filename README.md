# 2.5-month-of-microsoft-azure-machine-learning-challenge
This repo contains all the information related to Machine Learning for Microsoft Azure Scholarship Program of Phase-I and if selected then of Phase-II as well.


## Day 4: July 17, 2020. #50DaysofUdacity
- My current progress is:\
  **1. Introduction to Machine Learning on Azure** (Progress 11%)
    - **Lesson 2. Introduction to Machine Learning** (Progress 33%)
		- **Tabular Data**
		In machine learning, the most common type of data you'll encounter is tabular data—that is, data that is arranged in a data table.
		- **Scaling Data**
		Scaling data means transforming it so that the values fit within some range or scale, such as 0–100 or 0–1. There are a number of reasons why it is a good idea to scale your data before feeding it into a machine learning algorithm.
