## Day 5: July 18, 2020. #50DaysofUdacity
- My current progress is:\
  **1. Introduction to Machine Learning on Azure** (Progress 11%)
    - **Lesson 2. Introduction to Machine Learning** (Progress 33%)
		- **Encoding Categorical Data**
			- Ordinal Encoding 
			- One hot Encoding.
		- **Image Data**
		- **Text Data**
			- Normalization: Text normalization is the process of transforming a piece of text into a canonical (official) form.
				Lemmatization is an example of normalization .
				Stop words are high-frequency words that are unnecessary (or unwanted) during the analysis.
			- Vectorization: Process of creating simply an array of numbers/texts.
			- Feature Extraction
		- **Two Perspectives on ML**
			- Computer Science Perspectives
			We are using input features to create a program that can generate the desired output.
			- Statistical Perspective
			We are trying to find a mathematical function that, given the values of the independent variables can predict the values of the dependent variables.
		- **The Tools for Machine Learning**
		- **Libraries**
		- **Cloud Services**
			Models are the specific representations learned from data
			Algorithms are the processes of learning
				Model=Algorithm(Data)
		- **Models vs Algorithms**
		- **Linear Regression**
			The Cost Function
		- **Classical ML vs. Deep Learning**

## Day 4: July 17, 2020. #50DaysofUdacity
- My current progress is:\
  **1. Introduction to Machine Learning on Azure** (Progress 11%)
    - **Lesson 2. Introduction to Machine Learning** (Progress 33%)
		- **Tabular Data**
		In machine learning, the most common type of data you'll encounter is tabular data—that is, data that is arranged in a data table.
		- **Scaling Data**
		Scaling data means transforming it so that the values fit within some range or scale, such as 0–100 or 0–1. There are a number of reasons why it is a good idea to scale your data before feeding it into a machine learning algorithm.
