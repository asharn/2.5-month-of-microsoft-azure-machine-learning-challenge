## Day 26: August 8, 2020. #50daysofudacity 
- My current progress is:\
  **1. Introduction to Machine Learning on Azure** (Progress 61%)
    - **Lesson 4. Supervised & Unsupervised learning** (Progress 48%)
		- **Supervised Learning: Regression**
			> In a regression problem, the output is numerical or continuous.
			
			Common types of regression problems include:		
				- **Regression on tabular data:** The data is available in the form of rows and columns, potentially originating from a wide variety of data sources.
				- **Regression on image or sound data:** Training data consists of images/sounds whose numerical scores are already known. Several steps need to be performed during the preparation phase to transform images/sounds into numerical vectors accepted by the algorithms.
				- **Regression on text data:** Training data consists of texts whose numerical scores are already known. Several steps need to be performed during the preparation phase to transform text into numerical vectors accepted by the algorithms.
		- **Categories of Algorithms**	
			Common machine learning algorithms for regression problems include:
			- **Linear Regression**
				- Fast training, linear model
			- **Decision Forest Regression**
				- Accurate, fast training times
			- **Neural Net Regression**
				- Accurate, long training times

- My current progress is:\
  **1. Introduction to Machine Learning on Azure** (Progress 56%)
    - **Lesson 4. Supervised & Unsupervised learning** (Progress 19%)
		- **Lesson Overview** 
			First, we'll cover **supervised learning**. Specifically, we'll learn:
			- More about classification and regression, two of the most representative supervised learning tasks
			- Some of the major algorithms involved in supervised learning, as well as how to evaluate and compare their performance
			- How to use automated machine learning to automate the training and selection of classifiers and regressors, and how to use the Designer in Azure Machine Learning Studio to create automated Machine Learning experiments
			
			Next, the lesson will focus on **unsupervised learning**, including:
			- Its most representative learning task, clustering
			- How unsupervised learning can address challenges like lack of labeled data, the curse of dimensionality, overfitting, feature engineering, and outliers
			- An introduction to representation learning
			- How to train your first clustering model in Azure Machine Learning Studio
		- **Prelaunch Lab**
		- **Supervised Learning: Classification**
			> In a classification problem, the outputs are categorical or discrete.

			Some of the most common types of classification problems include:
			- Classification on tabular data: The data is available in the form of rows and columns, potentially originating from a wide variety of data sources.
			- Classification on image or sound data: The training data consists of images or sounds whose categories are already known.
			- Classification on text data: The training data consists of texts whose categories are already known.

    - **Lesson 2. Introduction to Machine Learning** (Progress 33%)
		- **Tabular Data**
		In machine learning, the most common type of data you'll encounter is tabular data—that is, data that is arranged in a data table.
		- **Scaling Data**
		Scaling data means transforming it so that the values fit within some range or scale, such as 0–100 or 0–1. There are a number of reasons why it is a good idea to scale your data before feeding it into a machine learning algorithm.
